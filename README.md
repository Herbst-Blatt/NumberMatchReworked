## Overview

This project is inspired by NumberMatch, a simple mobile game with the goal of emptying the gameboard by matching numbers. \
However, I have found some flaws with the game design, advertisement use and gaming experience of the original app, which have motivated me enough to rebuild the game myself from scratch to address these issues.\

This work in progress has been a nice warm-up after some time not programming due to my masters in Interaction Design. It reawakened my love for programming and a fun addition to my portfolio.
