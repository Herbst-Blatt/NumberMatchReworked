## Overview

This project is inspired by NumberMatch, a simple mobile game with the goal of emptying the gameboard by matching numbers. \
However, I have found some flaws with the game design, advertisement use and gaming experience of the original app, which have motivated me enough to rebuild the game myself from scratch to address these issues.
